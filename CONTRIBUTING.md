# Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an open source project. If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md), and its [README](./README.md).

## Tests

To be updated..
<!-- Write tests for every pull request you give -->

## Coding Style and Conventions

Follow PEP8, most importantly, indent by 4 space and use semicolons. Just kidding. :wink:
